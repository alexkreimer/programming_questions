'''
You are given an array of stock prices for a company for some period of time
(in the code below the array is stock_prices). Write a function that calculates
the time to buy and sell stock so that the profit is maximal.  Some rules that
you need to obey:
* You may buy one time and sell one time.
* You must buy before you sell.
* Please write nice
* DO NOT copy/paste anything from the internet
* Comment all your code
